## Description
This is a web application to help track budget. The application saves transactions that you input into an online database. If there is no internet connection, it will save the transactions to cache, until the application is back online. Once the application is back online, it will send in the transactions to be saved in the database.

## Usage
To use the application, go to the [deployed link](https://budget-tracker-el.herokuapp.com/).
At the top of the page, there is your total budget.
Fill in the fields required, such as a name for the transaction and the amount.
To add to your budget, click the add funds button to add the amount of the transaction to your total.
To subtract from your budget, click on the subtract funds button.
There is a chart, as well as a graph, that tracks your most recent transactions.
The application will still work offline as it is stored in the cache. When transactions are entered offline, they are stored in the cache until the application is line.
Once the application is online again, it will update the database with the entries in the cache.
